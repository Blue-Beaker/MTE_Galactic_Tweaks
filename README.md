All features are configurable.  
### Features
#### Universal Fluid Ejection
When enabled, GC machines will eject fluids in its output to all forge-capable blocks, like tanks and pipes from other mods.  
#### EU Power Tier Limit
Change the voltage of EU power can be inserted to GC blocks without exploding. Defaults to 5 (8192EU), while GC has 3 (512EU) originally.
#### IC2 Input Power Tier Fix
When importing power from IC2, IC2 voltage >=2V can now boost GC machines.  
GC wires are capped at 2V. Use IC2 cables for higher tiers and better speed.
